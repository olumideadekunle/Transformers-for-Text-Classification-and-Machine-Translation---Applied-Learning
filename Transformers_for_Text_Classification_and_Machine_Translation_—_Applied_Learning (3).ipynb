        "* Despite attempts to improve model evaluation by using comprehensive metrics (F1-score, precision, recall, BLEU, ROUGE), the process encountered persistent CUDA errors during the text classification evaluation step, preventing the successful calculation and printing of these metrics for classification. Machine translation metrics (BLEU and ROUGE) were successfully calculated, though the scores were low, likely due to the un-fine-tuned model.\n",
        "* Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning for the text classification model also failed due to a persistent CUDA error during the trainer initialization, preventing any training or evaluation with the new parameters.\n",
        "* Three professional tasks suitable for fine-tuning language models were identified: Domain-Specific Text Classification (e.g., healthcare sentiment analysis), Specialized Information Extraction (e.g., extracting data from financial reports), and High-Quality Machine Translation for Specific Industries (e.g., legal document translation). Fine-tuning allows for better understanding of domain-specific nuances and terminology, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.\n",
        "* Efforts to add detailed documentation and improve code structure by adding comments and docstrings were successful, enhancing code readability and adherence to style guidelines.\n",
        "* Implementing version control using Git and GitHub was initiated, with local repository initialization and committing succeeding. However, the process failed to connect to a remote GitHub repository as this step requires manual user interaction.\n",
        "* Creating interactive demos using Gradio for both text classification and machine translation was successful, providing simple web interfaces to showcase the models.\n",

        "\n",
        "* The persistent CUDA errors encountered during model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning steps suggest a potential issue with the CUDA environment setup or compatibility with the libraries/models used. Further investigation into the environment configuration is needed to resolve these errors and enable successful training and evaluation.\n",
        "* While local Git operations were successful, the inability to connect to a remote GitHub repository highlights the need for manual steps to complete the version control setup. Users would need to manually create a GitHub repository and add it as a remote origin to push their code."

Machine translation metrics (BLEU and ROUGE) were successfully calculated, though the scores were low, likely due to the un-fine-tuned model.\n",

Fine-tuning allows for better understanding of domain-specific nuances and terminology, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.\n",

Further investigation into the environment configuration is needed to resolve these errors and enable successful training and evaluation.\n",
        "*   While local Git operations were successful, the inability to connect to a remote GitHub repository highlights the need for manual steps to complete the version control setup. Users would need to manually create a GitHub repository and add it as a remote origin to push their code.\n"

📈 Key Learnings

Hugging Face simplifies fine tuning of large NLP models.

Transfer learning drastically reduces the required data and compute.

Domain-specific fine-tuning enhances translation accuracy.

Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, BLEU) are essential for model validation.

💡 Future Work

Expand fine-tuning dataset to multiple domains (finance, legal, etc.).

Deploy the fine tuned model via an API endpoint (e.g., FastAPI + Gradio).

Experiment with multilingual models like mBERT or NLLB for cross-language tasks.
